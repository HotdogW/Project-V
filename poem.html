    <h1>Salem's Valentine</h1>
    <pre>wanna be with you forever the ride or die way

when i look at you my body kinda vibrates,

i always get caught up, lost in your eyes gaze,

always locked in there, it feels like time stays,

i remember all your kisses, how they had a nice taste

i wanna do it so bad i could kiss for five days,

so many thought about kissing you, yeah my mind races,

i gotta slow it down, were going at a fine pace,

i look at you again you have such a nice face,

a babe, so cute the height of my day,

a baby, my baby, easy like childs play,

give my thanks to cupid, kid’s got a fine aim

a baby, how silly a child that binds fate

a baby, uhhh, baby wont you come my way

im not a good poet i gave it a try babe

i love you a whole lot, happy valentines day</pre>
