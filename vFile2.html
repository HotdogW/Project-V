                <h3>i wanna kiss you all over and make you purple</h3>
                <p>i do wanna try this though- i wanna see if it actually works, 
                    i wonder what drinks we should try to get our tongues like that. 
                    when my tongues like that before i kiss you im gonna be like PURPLE! </p>
                <p>speaking of purple, i like had to match the bg colour to your specific purple heart emmoji colour,
                    and like figuring out which specific emoji you had was pretty tedious cause like </p>
                <p>idk when you got your phone</p>
                <p>idk if you keep your os updated</p>
                <p>i dont even know which specific phone you have</p>
                <p> so i had to figure it out without being obvious about it :P</p>
