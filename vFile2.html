                <P>took a bit of time actually, and its like a more fluffed up version of what it was originally gonna be</P>
                <p>if you wanna read the original youre gonna have to like call my name three times or something idk</p>
                <p>uhh anyways, <a href = "poem.html">here you go</a>, hope its not too cringe </p>
                <p>i guess this whole thing is cringe if you give it some thought</p>
                <p>but I DONT CARE i love you 💜 i refuse to let the cringe stop me </p>
                <p>i will fight the war for my love and avenge my friends who died to the cringe alongside me</p>
                <p>for <a class = easterEgg href = avenger.html>i am an avenger</a></p>
                <p>lmao</p>
                <p>im having so much fun writing this btw its so poopy that i had to hide it but i wanted to surpise you</p>
                <p>this was the touchy subject btw i dunno if you remember that</p>

                <h3>i wanna kiss you all over and make you purple</h3>
                <p>i do wanna try this though- i wanna see if it actually works, 
                    i wonder what drinks we should try to get our tongues like that. 
                    when my tongues like that before i kiss you im gonna be like <a class = "easterEgg" href = "purple.html">PURPLE!</a> </p>
                <p>speaking of purple, i like had to match the bg colour to your specific purple heart emoji colour,
                    and like figuring out which specific emoji you had was pretty tedious cause like </p>
                <p>idk when you got your phone</p>
                <p>idk if you keep your os updated</p>
                <p>i dont even know which specific phone you have</p>
                <p> so i had to figure it out without being obvious about it :P</p>
                <p> i still even after making this dont know any of these details, 
                    i literally took <a href = ss.html>a screenshot of the emoji on your phone</a> and like on whatsapp 
                    and in your emoji window the purple heart was 2 different colours, it was so frustrating
                    so like if the thing doesnt match,
                    my bad, the site is better optimized for pc anyhow</p>
                <p>switch to pc if youre using your phone pls, i promise it way cooler to look at</p>
                <p>(ill assume you did)</p>
                <p>OMG ITS LIKE YOU NEVER LEFT</p>
                <p><a class = "easterEgg" href = "msmagica.html">its like magic youre like ms magica, with your uhh magic and stuff.</a> 
                   if we were magical girls id never let you become a witch btw, and if you did, id go back in time like sasquerella
                </p>
                <p>that was such an amazing show, i hope that we can continue to watch dumb dubs and be funny together all the time, 
                    and like make stupid connections between the shows. ive never done stuff like that before and like its so fun i love that you introduced me to this type of comedy
